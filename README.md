��# Exitor
Landing Page for the Exitor Platform



To run the page:

clone and run the following commands on the CLI at the root of the project:

```npm install```

to install the dependencies

and later run:

```npm start```

To view the landing page

you can also run ```npm run build``` to create a build version of it


If you do not want to run the project locally, run via the Gitpod button at the far right and run the same npm scripts above.

Thank you


This project is only production focused for the landing page aspect. There are still many features to be worked on in progress
